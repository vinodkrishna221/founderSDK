# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the enhancement of visual mockups in `.kiro/steering/ui-mockups.md` to provide comprehensive, detailed, and implementable design specifications for the Founder's Compass platform. The enhanced mockups will serve as the single source of truth for UI implementation, covering all major user flows, component states, and responsive behaviors.

### Design System Enhancement

The enhanced mockups will include:

1. **Precise Spacing Specifications**: Using Material-UI's 8px grid system
2. **Component Mapping**: Direct correlation to Material-UI components
3. **State Management**: Visual representation of all interactive states
4. **Accessibility Indicators**: WCAG compliance markers and focus states

## Components and Interfaces

### Enhanced Mockup Components

#### 1. Detailed Page Layouts
- **Header Component**: With exact dimensions, spacing, and responsive behavior
- **Navigation Systems**: Sidebar, bottom navigation, and breadcrumbs with state indicators
- **Content Areas**: Grid systems, card layouts, and information hierarchy
- **Footer Components**: Links, legal information, and contact details

#### 2. Interactive Elements
- **Form Components**: Input fields, dropdowns, checkboxes with all states
- **Button Variations**: Primary, secondary, text, and icon buttons with hover states
- **Data Display**: Tables, lists, cards with sorting and filtering indicators
- **Feedback Elements**: Alerts, snackbars, dialogs, and confirmation modals

#### 3. Indian-Specific Components
- **Government Scheme Cards**: With official styling and information hierarchy
- **Currency Displays**: Rupee formatting and financial data presentation
- **Legal Document Layouts**: Template previews and download interfaces
- **Regional Selectors**: State/city dropdowns with Indian geography

#### 4. Premium Feature Indicators
- **Upgrade Prompts**: Subtle but clear premium feature indicators
- **Payment Interfaces**: Integration with Indian payment gateways
- **Feature Comparison**: Free vs premium feature matrices
- **Subscription Management**: Billing and plan management interfaces

## Data Models

### Mockup Specification Format

```
Component Specification:
├── Component Name: [Material-UI Component]
├── Dimensions: [Width x Height in px/rem]
├── Spacing: [Margin/Padding using 8px grid]
├── Colors: [Primary/Secondary/Accent with hex codes]
├── Typography: [Material-UI variant and customizations]
├── States: [Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading]
├── Responsive Behavior: [Breakpoint-specific changes]
└── Accessibility: [ARIA labels, focus indicators, contrast ratios]
```

### User Flow Documentation

Each major user flow will include:
- **Entry Points**: How users arrive at the flow
- **Step-by-Step Progression**: Visual representation of each step
- **Decision Points**: Branching paths and conditional logic
- **Success/Error States**: Completion and failure scenarios
- **Exit Points**: How users leave or complete the flow

## Error Handling

### Visual Error State Design

1. **Form Validation Errors**
   - Inline field-level error messages
   - Form-level error summaries
   - Success confirmation states

2. **Network and Loading Errors**
   - Connection timeout displays
   - Retry mechanisms and buttons
   - Offline state indicators

3. **Content Not Found States**
   - Empty search results
   - No data available screens
   - 404 and error page designs

4. **Permission and Access Errors**
   - Premium feature restrictions
   - Authentication required prompts
   - Insufficient permissions messages

## Testing Strategy

### Mockup Validation Approach

1. **Design System Consistency**
   - Color palette adherence checking
   - Typography scale compliance
   - Spacing system validation

2. **Responsive Design Testing**
   - Breakpoint behavior verification
   - Mobile touch target validation
   - Cross-device layout consistency

3. **Accessibility Compliance**
   - Color contrast ratio verification
   - Focus state visibility testing
   - Screen reader compatibility indicators

4. **Indian Context Validation**
   - Cultural appropriateness review
   - Regulatory compliance checking
   - Local user experience validation

### Implementation Guidelines

The enhanced mockups will include:

1. **Developer Handoff Specifications**
   - Exact CSS/Material-UI prop specifications
   - Asset requirements and optimization guidelines
   - Animation and transition specifications

2. **Quality Assurance Checklists**
   - Visual regression testing points
   - Cross-browser compatibility requirements
   - Performance optimization guidelines

3. **Content Management Guidelines**
   - Dynamic content handling specifications
   - Localization and translation considerations
   - Content update and maintenance procedures

## Integration Points

### Material-UI Theme Integration

The mockups will specify:
- Custom theme overrides for Indian context
- Component variant definitions
- Responsive breakpoint customizations
- Color palette extensions for government schemes

### Content Management System Integration

Visual specifications for:
- CMS content display patterns
- Dynamic content loading states
- Content editing interfaces
- Version control and approval workflows

### Payment Gateway Integration

Mockups will include:
- Razorpay/PayU interface integration patterns
- UPI and digital wallet display options
- Subscription management interfaces
- Invoice and receipt layouts

This comprehensive design approach ensures that the enhanced mockups serve as a complete implementation guide while maintaining the Indian startup ecosystem focus and Material-UI design consistency.
